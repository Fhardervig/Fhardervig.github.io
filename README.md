# Guiding Star

The repository was our deliverable for a final project, with Globe3.html being the final product.
It creates a website with an interactable globe much like google earth with markers holding information and links to various opporunities to engage with the space sector. We also created our own basic filtering system, which consists of checkboxes in the top where one can filter for categories and experience levels, e.g. by checking 'High School', 'Camps' and 'Competitions', we will only display the markers containing camps and competitions aimed at high school students. If no boxes are ticked, all markers will show.
